# signal-denoising

## TODO list:
1. add generation of polygausse noise
2. refactor code to generate signals with different lenghts
3. write separate classes for training and models itself
4. generate big dataset (about 10k examples to start)
5. train models on the dataset
6. create comparison table with metrics
7. optional: convert signals to the spectrogram
